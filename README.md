# ZenAdmin

This is a rather old implementation of a CakePHP 2.5+ application, used as a base app for several webapps, api only interfaces, and the such.

The app has a few Cake Plugins installed, and uses custom baked models, controllers and views, with an old Twitter Bootstrap 2 plugin, that still works. It also has a special `cake inject` script that works fairly well, and basically injects in models, controllers and/or views different commonly used functionality. This is not a state-of-the-art app, not even close, but has served it's purpose for a long time and many guys I've worked with might still use it. Hell, maybe I'll use it in a hurry :).
